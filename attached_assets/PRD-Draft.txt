## 🟢 Product Manager Prompt: LawnMates PRD Creation

Create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) for **LawnMates**, a Canadian web-based platform that connects property owners (residential or commercial) with local landscapers for lawn maintenance. The platform enables job posting, discovery, secure payment, and photo-verified job completion.

* Build a frictionless, secure, and scalable MVP for a two-sided lawn care marketplace.
* Launch in select Canadian cities using a map-based job discovery and escrow payment model.
* Ensure high trust via photo verification, fair pricing, and clear job expectations.

### 🧑‍💼 Users

1. **Property Owners**: Individuals or businesses needing lawn mowing, trimming, or seasonal cleanup.
2. **Landscapers**: Freelancers or businesses offering lawn maintenance.
3. **Admin Team**: Handles disputes, verifies photos, manages user reports, and monitors marketplace health.
