## 📦 Feature Folder Pattern

* `src/features/auth/` → Login, RBAC, JWT
* `src/features/jobs/` → Post, discover, accept jobs
* `src/features/payments/` → Stripe logic
* `src/features/photos/` → Upload, verify
* `src/features/messaging/` → Realtime chat
* `src/features/admin/` → Dashboard, moderation

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Sensitive keys like Stripe and Supabase must be configured via Vercel or `.env.local`. See `lawnmates-standards-and-models` for the full list.

## 🧠 AI Agent Tips

* Follow naming conventions and file structure
* All APIs are REST in `pages/api/`
* Types live in `common/types/`
* Feature logic lives under `src/features/{domain}/`
