## 1. Testing Scope

* **Critical Functional Areas:**

  * User authentication & role logic

  * Payment flows (escrow, release, refund)
  * Photo uploads and verification
  * Messaging and notifications
  * Admin tools and dispute handling

* **Supported Platforms:**

  * Mobile and desktop browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
  * Responsive design tested at standard breakpoints

## 2. Test Types & Tools

### Unit Tests

* **Scope:** Component logic, utility functions, API responses
* **Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library

### Integration Tests

* **Scope:** Feature modules (e.g., job + payment, chat + notification)
* **Tools:** Jest + mocks, Supertest (for backend)

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

* **Scope:** Full flows (sign-up → post job → pay → complete)
* **Tools:** Cypress (UI and backend workflows)

### Accessibility (a11y) Tests

* **Scope:** Forms, buttons, contrast, keyboard nav
* **Tools:** axe-core (Cypress plugin or browser devtools)

### Performance Tests

* **Scope:** Map rendering, job feed load, image upload
* **Tools:** Lighthouse, Web Vitals, Vercel Analytics

### Security Tests

* **Scope:** JWT auth, API access control, XSS upload protection
* **Tools:** Manual testing, Supabase policies, ESLint plugins

## 3. Testing Environments

* **Local Dev:** Full stack with mocked services if needed
* **Staging:** Mirror of production with real services (Stripe test mode)
* **Production:** Smoke tests post-deploy

## 4. Test Coverage Goals

| Area              | Target Coverage                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Unit Tests        | 80%+                                     |
| Integration Tests | Key flows only                           |
| E2E Tests         | All critical flows (auth, job lifecycle) |
| a11y Compliance   | WCAG 2.1 AA                              |

## 5. Test Automation & CI

* **CI Tool:** GitHub Actions
* **Triggers:** On PR open/merge to `main` or `dev`
* **Jobs:**

  * Run lint and format checks
  * Run all tests and coverage check
  * Build preview deploy on Vercel (PR)

## 6. Manual Testing Checklist

* Role-based dashboards load correctly
* Stripe payment test cards work end-to-end
* Photo upload handles size/format edge cases
* Notifications and emails trigger correctly
* Admin overrides are restricted and logged
